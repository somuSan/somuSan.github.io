Iâ€™m a final year Undergrad student at IEM, Kolkata w/ an Electrical Engineering Major, While I always had my heart set on ML.

I'm interested in the research aspect of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, mainly in the field of computer vision [moderate knowledge in NLP].

I am active on a site called Kaggle, participated in a few Kaggle competitions. I'm Notebook and Discussion Expert there. My competition stats,

Participated in two competitions,

1. [*Sartorius - Cell Instance Segmentation [214th - TOP 15%]*](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sartorius-cell-instance-segmentation/leaderboard)

2. [*TensorFlow - Great Barrier Reef [57th - TOP 3%, silver medal]*](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-great-barrier-reef/leaderboard)

During my internship at IIT, KGP I managed to publish a paper on unsupervised segmentation at ICORT, 2021, IEEE.

I'm very passionate about the AV [Autonomous Vehicle] industry and currently trying to grasp some of the concepts associated with the field.
 
### **ðŸ’¡ I am actively looking for research opportunities in the field of AV or computer vision in general.**
