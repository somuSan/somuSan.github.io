watching some amaizing people in the field on ML I understood that I really lag a lot of skills. The main fear im facing right now is that, Im not totally fearless when it comes to coding, Like if you give me to code something like transformer model, defusion model, even simple neural network ingeneral I wont be able to do that. Its not like its not possible, but I think it will take me time, and wont be done in one go. and this is entirely because I have less practice in solving coding problem.

The major thing that I lag is interpreting things. The skill of interpreting things is commonly found in programming challenges.

So because of this entire reason I want to solve coding questions from codeforces, leetcode, impliment research papers, take complex projects.

I saw george hotz, in his live coding. These things realised me how much I lag. Not only coding anything and everything, like im completely unaware about the internals, like python internals or any CS fundamentals, DSA etc. tec., I have only surface level veiw. solving any complex problem anytime.

The reason im like this is because I Im from EE background, though im from EE, I dont have knowledge on EE eight, I made a lot of mistakes, my mind set was not right, I was not cheasing the proper goals.

In this whole thing, through these heap of problems, one of the things that is helping me the most is my inner competativeness and eagerness to learn.

Solution of these porblems:

Find the topics that you want to improve, fix a time limit and Try to learn them by yourself. If you are unable to do that go for M.tech.
But I cant really go straight for M.tech. I have to secure a path to finance my family, for that I might need to work for 1 or 2 years in a company environment and income some heavy money, after I do that I have to find the time to go for M.tech.
I know going for M.tech will be a lot more difficult, and that might help me in long run. Bu the easiest/most convenient way is to stay at the lab, beg to them to pay you a bit much and stay there and learn by yourself. Coz staying here I might not find proper peer group, but I will get the inferstructure, time, resources.
This on what I want to work on,


- Maths
- Optimization
- Code deep learning
- Data Structure and Algorithm
- Computer vision basics
- Do lots of coding problem solving
- Do lots of paper implimentation
- Do lots of complex projects
- Learn bit about computer architectures
