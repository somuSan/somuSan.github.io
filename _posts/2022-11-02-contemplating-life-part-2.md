# Contumplating my life [part 2]

I cant describe things pretty well, I also have a very small vocabolary, I dont really much things to talk about when I hang out with people, there is no much special about me, my views/observations from the world is pretty decent, Im also not much creative. But, let me tell you now what "do" I have, the passion to learn, the inner excitement to keep on going for one thing for longer perioud of time, commitment to myself that I will finish the thing that I started and put every ounce of my effort to make it more unique, creative and successful, competative mindset,...I just want to soak in all the things that excites me. TBH Im a very passionate guy, I could have turned out differently if I did not had some harsh chrildhood experience [fyi, my parents has nothing to do with it]. 

I believe there few common qualities that strong,inteligent ppl crries, they are very good at observing things, memorization, leearning by heart, apply that they learned very fast. These 4 are deadly combination. If some one has this killer four they can achieve anything in life. But apparently im a average guy, who get depressed very easily, blame on the things that has nothing to do with my state of being, asking foolish questions, unproductive/procastinator, not taking quick actions, not having the ability of getting things done even if I dont want to do that, low confidence, hasitate to talk, talk cleverly[spycing things up], dont want to get out of my comfort zone, and a lot more things[will add later]. So, by reading this you might feel I hate my "currrent" myself, and you are right. I truely need a complete make over for my personality. I wont really say I want to remove all of the things but there are a shit ton of things that I want to add to my personality. And here by I commit to myself that I will put in work to change those.

I'm still living of fear and low confidence, like common man! You are just in your 20s. If you don't do experiments with yourself now, when would you do, when you are 50-60 years old? There is only one way to get out of depression and that is self-improvement and focusing on yourself, and becoming that man that you crave to be. Doing these things will keep you busy and you won't have time to compare yourself with others and get depressed. Long time back I saw a tweet on my timeline that said every man should have 3 different types of hobbies. 

1. creative hobbies [dance, singing, music etc.]

2. hobbies that involve intelligence [chess, maths, coding]

3. hobbies that are physical [football, jijutsu, gym etc.]

Everybody has some kind of passion or things that are very close to their heart. For some it's songs/music, anime, movies, games etc. The thing about which you can talk for hours. I need to find those and do them.

I will take a challenge. If I see someone for 6 straight days, I will initiate a conversation with them. Coveration wont be because of any need for myside or the other side but its just about you are communicating with people in your environment, which is a good thing.
