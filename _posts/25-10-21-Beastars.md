This is a great anime, and it has been in lots of recommendations for its season 2. I have not seen the season 2 yet, but I bet its as good as season 1. I thing that resonnated with me the most 
was the male protagonist, i feel that we have similarity in our personalities,I can observe some poor qualities(in others eyes) like shy, introverted, and the feeling of nervioousness time to time and also some good qualities
like genuin, kind, thinking about others and also the quality of determination I mean, our lead can be a shy, nervous, bit occward but if he tries his best then he can really succeed. This success im talking about is 
different for both of us, and its for you too. The thnig im laking is friend(/friends), I needed atleast one guy who can understand and whom i can trust. I will talk about this feeling of loneliness if I decide to
write about another anime called "Horimiya". 

Its actually a slice of life/ romance type of anime so lots of drama is involved. But the plots shown over here are absolutely logical and the things that a loner would do. If I talk 
about love then the thing that i dont like is being a simp, but if you see the whole season 1 you might staring to tink that the male lead is one, but I can give the logic behind his actions and why
he is not a simp. I dont like being cheated on or being used(no one likes) and by the beginning of episode 5, I understood that things can go that way, and because of that I stoped watching this anime(this happened in 2020).

But today I was having bit of a rough day, and I felt that the people I used to know are not the same person anymore. People just using me. But if i think about it carefully I should not have 
felt that way, because this happened to me before. And these are the thing, how people threated you, your past experience with perple which stops us trusting each other. But I will see through the end.
Enough talking about my life. lets talk about the anime (why Legosi from Beastars is not a simp).


Will finish this soon...
