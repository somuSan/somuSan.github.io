2. Easily Finding the Answer to any Number Multiplied by 11
Most children do end up memorizing the multiplication tables up to 10. But this can be taken one step further by knowing how to multiply with 11 as well quickly.

Let’s try multiplying 45 with 11.
Separate the digits, 4 and 5 with a space between them, such as 4 [ ] 5.
Now, carry out the addition of the two digits in the centre, such as 4 [4+5 = 9] 5.
That’s your answer. 45 x 11 = 495.
If the sum happens to be a two-digit number, such as with 56, which yields 5 [11] 6, simply add the tens place of the sum with the first digit.
This would then be [5+1 = 6] [1] 6, making the answer as 616.
3. Multiplying any Number Quickly by 9
In more multiplication tricks, multiplying any number by 9 can be even faster.


Take a large number such as 754.
To multiply this with 9, simply add a 0 at the end and subtract the original number.
That makes it 7540 – 754 = 6786. That’s how quick it is!

13. You will Always Return to the Phenomenal Fifteen
Yet another trick that makes you return to the number fifteen no matter what number you choose.

Let’s pick a number such as 279.
Multiply it by 3. So, 279 x 3 = 837.
Now add 45 to the answer. So, 837 + 45 = 882.
Multiply that answer by 2. So, 882 x 2 = 1764.
Divide this answer by 6. This will give you 1764 / 6 = 294.
Subtract your original number from this answer.
That makes it 294 – 279 = 15. Surprising, right?

7. Be it Large or Small, You will Always Reach Eight
A step up from the previous one, this works on choosing any number at all.

Let’s choose the number 53.

Subtract 1 from it, so 53 – 1 = 52.
Multiply by 3, so 52 x 3 = 156.
Add 12 to it. So, 156 + 12 = 168.
Divide this by 3. So, 168 / 3 = 56.
Add 5 to this answer and subtract the original number. So, 56 + 5 – 53 = 8.
