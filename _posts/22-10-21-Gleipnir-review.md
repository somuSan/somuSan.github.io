"Gleipnir" was just the right thing that I was looking for, since the placement season has ended, my long pledged days of restaining myself from watching animes and using social
media are also has seen their last days. Before that I watched the 5 episodes of "Sunny Boy", I liked it too, but the thrill that was inside "Gleipnir", was something else. I always had an attraction toward action 
fictions and adventure(bit of dark type) type animes where the protagonist is not much strong but tries his/her best and he/she does that for good a cause, and "Gleipnir" was a perfect fit, not only that
you find a bit of a camestry between the male and the female protagonist. And oh my god she was lit, have seen twitter posts from some weebs getting waifu vibes from her. Beacause 
of that it was a bit at the Ecchi side. Dont know much about feamle followers but i ben male weebs are definitely gonna love that. Last I felt that good when I watched "Re-Zero".

Animation wise it was good but as not good as Chainsaw Man but it was fairly standard. As per as charecter development goes, it was almost on the mark, in between the episodes it felt a bit 
hezzy though. Actually if I think carefully, character development was not that bad, as time goes by you get to know all the charecters, and see the developments they went through. Just see the 
male lead(Shuich), at the first look he looked very nerdy, kind, gental guy who is not much nerdy, but as the season progressed he became more manly and a strong hearted person. Also If you look 
as the female lead Clair, At the beginning she was bold, reckless, a girl who does not give a fuck about anything except her own desires, but gradually you start observing the changes, the softness inside of her.

Aaaa, Lets talk about Clair Aoki, this is the charecter on whome every other guy is simping over(not their fault thoughüòè). My first impression of this female charecter was a 
"manupulative woman" with a sence of perpose, she looked quite bold from outside but in deep down she was a kind person who cares about others feelings.And you know(if you are used
to of watching animes) that this is all surcumstancial outcome.The voice of the female dub for this charecter was very apealing too. And the thing that will excite most of the men that,clair stripes 
off her dress almost in every sciene. Based on the recless vibes she was emitting, I thought Shuichi (the male main character) would be used by her, and she will forget about him like a hoe.
But things turned pretty interesting after few episodes. If you dont know, our male main character is a studious, gental, soft person, Lived a normal life till he start getting the 
simtopms that something is wrong with himself. And the season progresses he turns himself into a strong hearted "man" with a clear desire, and the credit of this goes to Clair, they make a good duo. I still
remember the last words of Shuichi from the 13th/last episode, "There it is, I can always feel it, this town is the center of a incredible story, played out in real time. All i know is that
I'm not the main character, I keep thinking I should step off the stage, just remove myself from the plot, live a normal life (but then I feel) this story doesn't center on me but when it comes
time for the climax, it need a resolution, thats when we will enter, we will be the who finds the answer, we have to belive...". 


Well the wait for the 2nd season is still there although I just have finished the first seasionüòÖ. Tried to keep the review as spoiler free as possible hope you enjoyed. And if someone has suggested you to watch that 
then you know why.
