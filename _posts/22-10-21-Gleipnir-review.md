"Gleipnir" was just the right thing that I was looking for. Since the placement season has ended, my long pledged days of restraining myself from watching animes and using social media have also seen their last days. Before that I watched the 5 episodes of "Sunny Boy", I liked it too, but the thrill that was inside "Gleipnir", was something else. I always had an attraction toward action **fiction and adventure (bit of dark type) type** animes where the protagonist is not much strong but tries his/her best and he/she does that for good a cause, and "Gleipnir" was a perfect fit, not only that you find a bit of a cemetery between the male and the female protagonist. And oh my god she was lit, have seen Twitter posts from some weebs getting waifu vibes from her. Because of that, it was a bit on the Ecchi side. Don't know much about female followers but I bet male weebs are definitely gonna love that. Last I felt that good when I watched "Re-Zero".

Animation wise it was good but not as good as Chainsaw Man but it was fairly standard, the opening song of the first seasion `altern-ate` <iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6IJJ8gIHQduNLbCIfvdSbF?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="380" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"></iframe> has a feeling of its own, I generally skip OPs but this time I was humbled, check it out here. As per as character development goes, it was almost on the mark, in between the episodes it felt a bit hazy though. Actually, if I think carefully, character development was not that bad. As time goes by you get to know all the characters and see the developments they went through. Just see the male lead(Shuichi), at the first look he looked very nerdy, kind, gentle guy who is not much nerdy, but as the season progressed he became more manly and a strong-hearted person. Also, if you look 
at the female lead Clair, in the beginning, she was bold, reckless, a girl who does not give a fuck about anything except her own desires, but gradually you start observing the changes, the softness inside of her.

Aaaa, let's talk about Clair Aoki. This is the character on whom every other guy is simping over(not their fault thoughüòè). My first impression of this female character was a "manupulative woman" with a sense of purpose. She looked quite bold from the outside but deep down she was a kind person who cares about others' feelings. And you know (if you are used to watching animes) that this is all a circumstantial outcome. The voice of the female dub for this character was very appealing too. And the thing that will excite most of the men is that Claire stripes off her dress almost in every scene. Based on the reckless vibes she was emitting, I thought Shuichi (the male main character) would be used by her, and she will forget about him like a hoe.

But things turned pretty interesting after a few episodes. If you don't know, our male main character is a studious, gentle, soft person who lived a normal life until he started getting the symptoms that something was wrong with him. And as the season progresses he turns himself into a strong-hearted "man" with a clear desire, and the credit for this goes to Clair. They make a good duo. I still remember the last words of Shuichi from the 13th/last episode, **"There it is, I can always feel it, this town is the center of an incredible story, played out in real-time. All I know is that I'm not the main character, I keep thinking I should step off the stage, just remove myself from the plot, live a normal life (but then I feel) this story doesn't center on me but when it comes time for the climax, it needs a resolution, that's when we will enter, we will be the who finds the answer, we have to believe...".** 


Well, the wait for the 2nd season is still there although I just finished the first seasonüòÖ. Tried to keep the review as spoiler-free as possible(check out the trailer below). Hope you enjoyed it. And if someone has suggested you watch that then you know why. As per [Spoiler guy](https://spoilerguy.com/gleipnir-season-2/) the 2nd season is going to release by 2022, till then watch it again and again.
