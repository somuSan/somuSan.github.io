I have worked in sar data as a part of my internship, I did not get a chance to collect the data[form softwares] and create different dicompositions, but I had to work on it 
considering the basic principals of a sar data. I had very minimal information about the dataset, good enough to get my job done. But looking backward I feel I 
should have studied more deeply into it. its been almost a year now, and now I got the time to dig deeper, and went through a lot of yt NPTL/IIRS videos and read
few articles. There is a lot to cover but the amount of information that I got going throught them is vast. I dont know I will be give justice to the consumed content
but I will surely try. 

This blog will be devided into 2-3 parts and I will go through different perspective of it, like the need of sar data, data collection, pros and cons, meaning behind the
collected data, how to interpret them. It might seem boring







To be specific it was polsar data.
