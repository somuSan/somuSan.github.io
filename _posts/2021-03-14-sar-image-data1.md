## Introduction:
Think bout life without Google maps, people use this all the time. Even your uber wont move an inch without google maps(or any software for aerial maps, apple maps excluded [meme]). Or think about life without your smartphone's weather forcasting, you wont be able to take a extra umbrale for your crush on a rainy day, life would really suck right? And these aerial maps, weather forcasting are by products of satellite imagery, and not only that forest fire detection, seasonal vegetation change tracking, flood mappiong, ship detection, oil spill detection, crop classification and the list goes on. What is really is creepy/sussy is we can measure, identify and track human activity with it. Posibilities are infinite [meme].

Satellite imagery comes under a broader topic called remote sensing, the name is pretty much self explanatory. The basic concept is to sense different information about
an object without getting into direct contact with the object. For that different kind of sensors are used, for example optical multispectral, thermal remote sensing, radar remote sensing, hyperspectral remote sensing, microwave remote sensing technique etc. Optical RST is a passive remote sensing technique and microwave RST is active imaging multilook RST. 

There are many advantages of using microwave remote sensing[also known as sar] over others, but few very important ones are
  1. SAR images can see through clouds, but other imagery techniques like optical or lidar are blocked by clouds. This is because of the different wavelengths used in different techniques, as the wavelength for SAR is 1mm - 100cm it can easily ignore the dust particlesof the cloud, but others cant.
  2. It can be used to detect objects in day and night both the times, same goes for lidar sensors,but unlike optical imagery. 







All i mean to say is that the importance of satelite





I have worked in sar data as a part of my internship, I did not get a chance to collect the data[form softwares] and create different dicompositions, but I had to work on it 
considering the basic principals of a sar data. I had very minimal information about the dataset, good enough to get my job done. But looking backward I feel I 
should have studied more deeply into it. its been almost a year now, and now I got the time to dig deeper, and went through a lot of yt NPTL/IIRS videos and read
few articles. There is a lot to cover but the amount of information that I got going throught them is vast. I dont know I will be give justice to the consumed content
but I will surely try. 

This blog will be devided into 2-3 parts and I will go through different perspective of it, like the need of sar data, data collection, pros and cons, meaning behind the
collected data, how to interpret them. It might seem boring







To be specific it was polsar data.
