I was watching some football shorts on yt today, and suddenly a video poped up, where a vert sweet small was smilling because Heung Min son waved her back. I was not sure who is this
person, because in that video his face wasn't visible. So I searched on yt, and it turned out that it was a korean player, playing at premier league. One of the video that poped
up because of my search was he and the goal keeper [both from the same team] fighting with each other. But later that matter cooled down, and in an interview that gool keeper ssaid that
"most of the time the craziest guy on the peach, they are teddy bear on their life".

And this statement made me remembered the time when I was competeing with a guy in batminton, and the way I approached him and won the match. During the match I was "I will be winning 
this match" on his face, and I won the match. Saying that out loud made me more serious and made me help to push my limits. I only took rational dicissions and scored. Although there 
were time when I almost loss to him, but I believe my detecmination made me push forward. 

And also some recent events, like when abhishek thakur made a high scoring NB public some other kagglers started criticizing him on public forums, when that NB was just for learning 
perpose of the other intermidiates/biginners. But abhishek did not take that easily and also started trolling and roasting them. And doing that is quite true because when you know 
that you are right when why not answer the opponent. But the mistake that he made[IMO] is that he ended up retiring from kaggle for a long time. when he was suppoed to take that as 
a challenge and win that comp by sharing some informative NB along the way. Its like "you dont like the way im taking the comp hha, what about now[do some public sharing], 
what about now[do some public sharing]". but I also think that he dont need to win the competition in order to prove himself, because he is already on top [his was in top 3 in eavry single
category] and also above than the others[who tolled him before].

I feel lile go brizerk dude, dont care about anything else not sleep, not eating, not even peeing just do one thing. When it is a mind game it is also a tiring job to keep your self consistent 
through out the 2-3 months period. Doing different experiments and keeping their tach. But at the end the person who is most consistent he wins. I lag in the brain and creative thinking 
depertment, so I really have to put effort in my consistency, and keep woring hard.

The sports of competitive data science is for learning and competion both at the same time, peopel learn from each other, try different solutions for 2-3 months and some dedicated
folks ended up breaking the LB with some new innovative solutions. 

# And I have decided that this time its all in, Im ok to give everything my sleep, my apatite everything. Only one thing Im gonna win a BRONZE in this comp, I kknow Im lagging a lot but I will catch up and get the BRONZE
# Dont take me lightly

Some advices:
-  think about kaggle as a sport. 
-  Act like a player in the field.
-  Show everyone who is the most passionate one, who is going risk everyting to win[not the bad ways].
-  It is a sport where learning and competing happens simultaneously, so share your best work and contribute to the community.
-  And also at the same time show your passion for the sport by doing most submission on the LB. Even if you dont get the highest LB score.
-  And always remember that you dont have to be messi to win the gave, you can be Ronaldo and still win the game.
-  Try every possible ways to improve your LB. take recessional decissions. Channel your energy in the right direction during the comp.  
-  Propperly communicate with everyone.
-  Become obsessed with the game.
